# OpenComputers-Drone_swarm
Multi part script to control multiple drones at once in the MC mod "OpenComputers"
The goal was to make a script that is like https://github.com/rahul-pisharody/OpenComputers-Delta-Swarm because that one isnt working and isnt in developement anymore so i decided to make my own

# How to use:
flash "eeprom" on an eeprom for a drone and craft it with 5 drones (drone needs an wireless card)
run "registration" on any pc or tablet or server with an wireless card
turn on all drones and wait til their standard color changes so you know that it registered (openign the drone inventory also shows the drones number)
once all 5 are registered the pc/server/tablet will tell you and will exit the script, now you can launch "swarm_ctrl" and controll the drones using the keys specified in the script

Currently there is no real GUI for controls etc. but thats in the works
